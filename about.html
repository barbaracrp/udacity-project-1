            <h2>My history</h2>
            <small class="gray-text"><time datetime="2020-08-02">Aug 2</time></small>
            <p>I'm Barbara Rodrigues, a web developer in progress, nurse, midwife, and passionate about cooking. Alex's wife, Anna and Nikolai's mom. Dog's mom of a Labrador Retriever called Judith. Mentored by my husband for IT issues.</p>
            <p>I am a graduate Nurse and Midwife. I worked in the Health Area between 2005 at 2017. Since I moved out of my country in 2017, I've been challenged to build a new career. Constantly moves from here to there the health area became a difficult career to be set. As my husband working with IT since 2009, I saw an opportunity to merge on this. My professional web development skill has been developing with online courses and mentored by my husband. I still have a lot of interest in the health area and  I keep me reading and studying about it.</p>
